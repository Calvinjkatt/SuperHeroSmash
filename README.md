DESCRIPTION

The model of our project will be Person vs Computer. Our game is based on the DC super hero dimension. There will be a button on the screen that allows you to pick between 1 of 3 superheroes which are: Batman, Superman and The Flash. Simultaneously the computer will respond with a random choice from the pool of superheroes. Upon choosing, the algorithm will select a winner, based on who overpowers the other. For convenience, and also for people who may not be familiar with the DC universe, we will display a tip sheet that  describes which choices of heroes are stronger than the others. Because draws are possible, we will make it so that the opponent that reaches 2 victories first will be the winner and the game will stop.
